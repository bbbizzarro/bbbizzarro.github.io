title: New Creative Mediums are Distractions
---



Already, I can sense my inner critic fomenting a censorship campaign in my head. This sensation arises from a superficial thought, rendered ridiculous by even a cursory swipe of reason: the thought that these words will be made public. I suppose there is a primitive reaction to the concomitant feeling of social vulnerability. A Kurzgesagt video on loneliness suggested a link between the feelings of loneliness and physical pain. It is not surprising that, although I understand that almost noone is likely to read these words, that I react viscerally to my first few keystrokes. My throat tightens as though from an allergic reaction and my breath takes on the sultry flavor of inhaling through a wet, cardboard tube. Of course, all these symptoms only serve to accelerate the oncoming train wreck of a social interaction. And now, of course, the title of this post refers to a post that was never written because this post was titled prematurely. How mysterious.
